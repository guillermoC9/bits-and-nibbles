   of chars consumed from a max of 'num'.

   Like in the base64 encoding the result is bigger
   than the original, 'dest' and 'origin' SHOULD NOT
   point the same buffer unless you know there is
   enough space available for the conversion.

   WARNING, this funci√≥n DO NOT add the NUL char
   and the resulting string is always a base64
   block (4 chars), padded with '=' if needed.

   'dest' is assumed to be able to hold 4 chars.

    The function stops after 4th chars or before
    if it finds a non base64 char.

    In this case, 'dest' and 'origin' can point to
    the same buffer as the output is smaller than
    the input.

/* -------------------------------------------------- *

   Encode a buuffer of bytes to base64 and return

   As usual with encoding, 'dest' should not point
   to the same buffer as 'orig'.

   This function always add the NUL char at the end
   even if there is not space to convert the whole
   buffer. The output is padded with '=' if the
   output is not a multiple of 4.

   Decodes the base64 string 'origin' onto 'dest'
   and return the number of bytes written to it.

   If ignore is TRUE, this function ignores all
   non-base64 chars and keep going until 'num'
   chars or until the NUL char is found before
   'num' chars, or 'num' is 0.

    If you would like the function to stop in
    the first non-base64 char that if finds,
    set 'ignore' to FALSE.

    In this case, 'dest' and 'origin' can point
    to the same buffer as the output is smaller
    than the input.
