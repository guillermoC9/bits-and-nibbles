        - This code is used to read documents in any delimiter-separated value
          format. Clearly dominated by CSV as popularized by Microsoft Excel and
          Microsoft Access.

        - Files can be encoded either in Microsoft's Windows 1252 codepage or
          UTF-8 but are internally converted to UTF-8 when read which is the
          enconding used in memory.

    Limits in the CSV are actually the same that in Microsoft Excel, which can be read here:

    https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Excel-specifications-and-limits-1672b34d-7043-467e-8e27-269d656771c3

    Note that although we respect the limit of 16,384 columns (cells) imposed by Microsoft Excel,
    our code here can be used to read over their limit of 1,048,576 rows, as rows here are returned
    one at the time, so that limit is informative only because the limit will really be imposed by
    the use of the rows by the caller. Although in practive we have a limit of 134,217,728 rows
    because there has to be a limit to avoid integer overflow. Yeah we could have used a bigger type,
    but it made not sense as our practical limit is already 128 times bigger than the official.
